0.0.2

A set of opinions and encapsulation for working with the browser's Drag and Drop API.


### Quick Start

```

// define a mixin with a functionality that occurs on a drag event.

var layerZIndex = (event) => { event.target.style.zIndex = '9999' } 

```

```
<!-- define a drag handler -->
<div draggable="true" ondragstart="handleDrag(event)">div</div>

```

```
// use the `dragMethods` api to pipe in the event, the use the `mixin` method
// to add functionality.

import { dragMethods as d } from './src/index'


var handleDragStart = (event) => d.handleEvent(event)
  .changeEffectAllowed('none')
  .mixin(layerZIndex)

```
